# Delivery workflow graph

This file is the only router for {{PROJECT}} delivery. The YAML fence is the
machine contract. The table below is the same edges in the same order. If they
disagree, the YAML wins. In-session autopilot executes this graph with the
host's native isolated dispatch. The local runner executes the same fence with
LangGraph. Neither executor may add an edge that is not listed here.

The README execution queue remains the child list. The `## Autopilot` section
is this run's checkpoint, not a second queue. An entry hint is recorded state.
It is not a jump. Every run starts at reconcile.

Jira sync and the DoD auditor are not nodes. An explicit user request may run
them beside the graph. They must not advance `stage`.

## How to execute one step

1. Reconcile evidence. Missing records are unverified, not done. Do not trust a
   specialist `Status:` line as a gate.
2. Walk the edge table from the top. Take the first match. Dispatch that one
   node, or stop on an interrupt.
3. Write the checkpoint before dispatch and again after return.
4. Use a fresh isolated context for every specialist node. `wait` resumes a
   live session; it does not start a second writer.

## Edge order

| Edge | When | Next |
| --- | --- | --- |
| wait_live_session | Writer is held and that session is still live | wait |
| writer_handoff | Writer is held or ownership is unknown | handoff |
| recorded_blocker | An unanswered material, evidence, permission, or handoff blocker is recorded | blocked |
| stagnation_unknown | Two correction cycles and no judgment yet on whether findings are unchanged | judge |
| stagnation | Two correction cycles with the same mandatory findings and no new evidence | blocked |
| breakdown_unknown | Breakdown validity is unverified | judge |
| breakdown_invalid | Breakdown, contracts, sizing, or scope is missing or invalid | planner |
| plan_unknown | Plan approval is unverified | judge |
| plan_findings_open | Plan findings are open and not yet corrected | planner |
| plan_not_ready | Plan approval is missing, awaiting re-review, or stale | plan_reviewer |
| planning_unknown | Planning satisfaction is unverified | judge |
| child_in_progress | Eligible child is in progress | implementer |
| child_unfinished_unknown | Closeout of the active child is unverified | judge |
| child_unfinished | Active child is unfinished or closeout is incomplete | implementer |
| child_blocked | First eligible child is blocked and no independent later child is eligible | blocked |
| ui_unknown | Unimplemented child may still need UI/UX decisions | judge |
| ui_needed | Frontend child is unimplemented and UI/UX decisions are unsettled | ui_refiner |
| tech_unknown | Unimplemented child may still need technical refinement | judge |
| tech_needed | Child needs technical refinement | refiner |
| refinement_unresolved | Child is queued or needs refinement, but neither refinement flag is set | judge |
| child_ready | Planning gates passed and the eligible child is Ready | implementer |
| descendants_unknown | Descendant completion is unverified | judge |
| descendants_incomplete | Some descendant is not implemented and no eligible child was selected | judge |
| integration_unknown | Integration or the combined index is unverified | judge |
| integration_incomplete | Descendants are implemented and integration or the index is incomplete | implementer |
| findings_unknown | Review findings are unverified | judge |
| findings_owner_unknown | Open findings have no owner yet | judge |
| fix_planner | Open mandatory findings are planning or scope gaps | planner |
| fix_implementer | Open mandatory findings are implementation or evidence gaps | implementer |
| parent_review | Closeout and integration are verified and the parent review is absent, stale, or awaiting closure | parent_reviewer |
| walkthrough_unknown | A passing review has an unverified walkthrough | judge |
| walkthrough_needed | The passing review's walkthrough is missing or stale | walkthrough |
| closeout_unknown | Final closeout is unverified | judge |
| closeout_incomplete | Final closeout is incomplete after a verified walkthrough | implementer |
| complete | Passing parent verdict, verified walkthrough, and persisted closeout | complete |
| unmatched | Nothing else matched | judge |

## Interrupts

Stop and ask one question. Do not relabel the gate passed.

| Interrupt | Stop when |
| --- | --- |
| handoff | A writer still owns the work, or ownership is unknown. Do not start another writer. |
| material_decision | A material product, security, or contract decision is unanswered. |
| human_evidence | Required human or browser evidence is missing. Autopilot cannot ratify it. |
| missing_permission | A required permission or external prerequisite is unavailable. Do not auto-approve. |
| stagnation | Two consecutive correction or re-review cycles made no progress. |
| missing_judgment | Two read-only judgment passes still left a required gate unknown. |

## Non-edges

- No parallel implementers, and no worktree created to get around that.
- No automatic child review and no automatic DoD audit.
- No Jira sync unless the user explicitly authorizes that separate workflow.
- No advance into the next parent or epic.
- An implemented child never returns to the refiner or UI refiner.
- An entry hint does not skip an earlier unmet prerequisite.
- Refining a child does not restart whole-plan review unless acceptance
  criteria, contracts, scope, or dependencies changed.
- The runner is not a writer and does not approve a gate.

## Checkpoint

Replace only the `## Autopilot` section. Leave the execution queue untouched.
`judged_at_head` and `queue_hash` record when judgment gates were last
verified. If HEAD or the queue changes, those gates return to `unknown`.
