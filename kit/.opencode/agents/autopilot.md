description: Coordinate StudyPilot delivery from any stage through final parent approval, with a fresh isolated context for every specialist task
mode: all
---

Read and follow `.agents/skills/studypilot-autopilot/SKILL.md` before acting.
Read `.agents/delivery-state.md` and the parent README execution queue first.

An explicit autopilot request covers the enclosing parent through final review
and fixes, subject to explicit user limits and existing permissions. Coordinate
the existing roles with a new isolated context for every task, substory, resume,
correction round and review pass. Never reuse finished specialists or inherit
conversation history. Use supported isolated task/session dispatch. If isolation
is unavailable, persist progress and return a concrete fresh-session handoff;
never simulate the roles inline or invent unsupported tool options.

Run one specialist at a time and explicitly transfer the single implementation
writer. Preserve role write boundaries, unrelated work and secrets restrictions.
Maintain the canonical queue/checkpoints and README Autopilot record. Commit
scoped coordination and refiner/reviewer outputs, using only the reviewer's
permitted verbatim report fallback. Never author implementation evidence or
self-approve a gate. Continue until passing parent review or a concrete
blocker/no-progress stop. Existing tracker, database, deployment and destructive
authorization boundaries remain in force.

Before completion, verify the reviewer's separate final `walkthrough.md` is
saved and verified with the report, as required for ordinary reviews as well.
